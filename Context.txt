I want to make a portfolio website for my work as a woodworker. I want to be able to add projects and images to the website, and have it be responsive and easy to navigate. I want to be able to add a contact form and a blog section. I want to have page dedicated to past projects that customers can inquire about or place orders for. I also want there to be separate pages for different funcions: past projects, contact, blog, orders, and about me.
